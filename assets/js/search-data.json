Within the IK system, the target (item at the end of the limb) and hint objects (item that that elbow points towards) are required to ensure the system is fully working. However, the current IK setup simply sets the hint weights very low, so the hints don’t affect the IK much. “Currently, the settings used in the above sets the value of the Hint Weight to be low to ensure that when we use our rotation gizmo or make changes to posekun without the IK system, these changes are retained instead of being overridden. However, take note that the lower the hint weight, the lesser the arm or leg will bend towards the hint object, which may lead to less realistic limb movement.” - January 2025 Documentation YouTube video with the same IK setup: Inverse Kinematics Unity Tutorial in 3 minutes .

This is because all objects in the skeleton layer are instead rendered on a separate camera. As seen, posekunCamera is the one responsible for rendering posekun onto the scene. The reason why there are 2 cameras used in this setup is to ensure that posekun will always render on top of other objects.

In the event that more objects need to be rendered into the scene at different depths, this camera setup can be replicated and modified to easily set the render order. ",
