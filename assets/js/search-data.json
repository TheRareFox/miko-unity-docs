Within the IK system, the target (item at the end of the limb) and hint objects (item that that elbow points towards) are required to ensure the system is fully working. However, the current IK setup simply sets the hint weights very low, so the hints don’t affect the IK much. “Currently, the settings used in the above sets the value of the Hint Weight to be low to ensure that when we use our rotation gizmo or make changes to posekun without the IK system, these changes are retained instead of being overridden. However, take note that the lower the hint weight, the lesser the arm or leg will bend towards the hint object, which may lead to less realistic limb movement.” - January 2025 Documentation YouTube video with the same IK setup: Inverse Kinematics Unity Tutorial in 3 minutes .

Key Components: . | Camera - Unity’s camera component for scene rendering | Transform Gizmo Script - Enables 3D manipulation gizmos for object transformation | . PosekunCamera . Purpose: Specialized camera dedicated to rendering the pose reference character (Posekun). Key Components: . | Camera - Secondary camera for pose character rendering | . User Interface . Canvas . Purpose: Root container for all UI elements, providing the foundation for the user interface system. SideMenu . Purpose: Debug panel that displays available poses in a scrollable menu format. Note: Primarily used for development and debugging purposes. Contains script to autopopulate PoseLibrary . PC . Purpose: Desktop-style UI panel containing various control buttons and options. Note: Primarily used for development and debugging purposes. Interactive Elements . HandEditorContents . Purpose: Prefab container for the hand pose editing interface. Important: Keep this GameObject inactive until needed for hand editing functionality. Indicator . Purpose: Template prefab for pose point visualization markers. Critical: This prefab is referenced by multiple systems - do not remove or relocate. JointIndicators . Purpose: Template prefab for animated joint indicators that highlight active pose points. Critical: This prefab is essential for pose point feedback - maintain its position in the hierarchy. ",
