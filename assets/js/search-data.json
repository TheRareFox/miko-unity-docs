Scene Hierarchy . You can explore each GameObject using Unity’s Inspector panel (shown on the right) to view their components and configuration. Core GameObjects . Root . Purpose: Central controller that manages scene-wide functionality and coordinates between different systems. Key Components: . | Enable Camera Script - Controls camera activation states | Root Behaviour Script - Main application logic controller | Root WebGL Script - WebGL-specific functionality | AdjustModel Script - Model transformation and scaling | Draw Posekun Script - Renders the pose visualization character | Screenshot Controller Script - Handles screenshot capture functionality | Add FBX Controller Script - Manages FBX model import and integration | Bodykun Controller Script - Controls the main character body manipulation | . Directional Light . Purpose: Provides global directional lighting to simulate sunlight and ensure proper scene illumination. Key Components: . | Light (Type: Directional) - Main lighting source for the scene | . EventSystem . Purpose: Unity’s input management system that handles all UI interactions, mouse events, and touch input. Key Components: . | EventSystem - Core input event detection and processing | StandaloneInputModule - Handles keyboard, mouse, and controller input for desktop platforms | . Camera System . CameraParent . Purpose: Parent container for camera hierarchy, enabling grouped camera movements and transformations. Key Components: . | Camera Controller Script - Manages camera movement, rotation, and zoom | Pose Bounding Box Script - Calculates and displays pose boundaries | . mainCamera . Purpose: Primary scene camera responsible for rendering the main view and supporting transform gizmo interactions. Key Components: . | Camera - Unity’s camera component for scene rendering | Transform Gizmo Script - Enables 3D manipulation gizmos for object transformation | . PosekunCamera . Purpose: Specialized camera dedicated to rendering the pose reference character (Posekun). Key Components: . | Camera - Secondary camera for pose character rendering | . User Interface . Canvas . Purpose: Root container for all UI elements, providing the foundation for the user interface system. SideMenu . Purpose: Debug panel that displays available poses in a scrollable menu format. Note: Primarily used for development and debugging purposes. Contains script to autopopulate PoseLibrary . PC . Purpose: Desktop-style UI panel containing various control buttons and options. Note: Primarily used for development and debugging purposes. Interactive Elements . HandEditorContents . Purpose: Prefab container for the hand pose editing interface. Important: Keep this GameObject inactive until needed for hand editing functionality. Indicator . Purpose: Template prefab for pose point visualization markers. Critical: This prefab is referenced by multiple systems - do not remove or relocate. JointIndicators . Purpose: Template prefab for animated joint indicators that highlight active pose points. Critical: This prefab is essential for pose point feedback - maintain its position in the hierarchy. ",
